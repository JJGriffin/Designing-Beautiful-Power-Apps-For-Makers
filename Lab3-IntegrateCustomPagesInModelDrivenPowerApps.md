# Lab 3: Integrate Custom Pages in a Model-Driven Power App

In this lab, you will integrate the custom pages you built in **Lab 2** into the **Coho Winery Purchase Order Management** model-driven app as both a full page and a side pane. Youâ€™ll pass the current record context to the custom page and render responsive UI with modern styling.

## Lab Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Embed a custom page as full page and Side Pane in the model-driven app for Coho Winery Purchase Order Application

### âœ… Prerequisites

Completed lab 1-3 

## Scenario
To be able to read the PDFs related to all purchase orders, the Coho Winery Purchase Order Management app must support viewing PDFs and provide end users with an option that makes the files easily assecible through the existing app. They also want to open the relevant record information. 

### âŒ› Length

45-60 minutes

### Assets You Will need

Custom pages from Lab 2 (e.g., Landing page and Side Pane custom page)

Purchase Order table (from Lab 1)

The model-driven app (from Lab 1)

New JS web resource: **CohoWinerySidePane.js**


## Exercise 1: Embedding a Full page as part of the Model-driven Application
We will begin by adding the **Coho Winery Landing page** to the MDA.

1. Navigate to the [Power Apps Maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and ensure you are in the **Developer** environment you created in Lab 0.
2. Select **Solutions** from the left navigation pane.

## Exercise 3: Getting Started with Command Bar Configuration

To trigger the side pane with the custom page, you will have to configure a command bar button to execute the JavaScript with the custom page reference

1. If you don't have the solution for **Coho Winery** open already, select it from **Solutions** and open the **Coho Winery Purchase Orders** model-driven application by clicking on the name

![Opening the model-driven app](image-18.png)
 
3. **Locate the Purchase Order table** and the three dots on the right - **Select** `Edit Command bar`  
 ![Locate command bar button](image-20.png)

4. **Choose** to edit the command bar on the  `Main Form ` and click  `Edit `

![Edit command bar on main form](image-21.png)

5. Create a new command bar button by **Selecting** `+New` â†’ `Command` on the ribbon to the left

![Create a new button](image-22.png)

6. Create a type of command for  `JavaScript ` and click  `Continue`

![Create command for JavaScript](image-23.png)

9. **Provide a name** for the button â†’ **Purchase Order Info** and choose an Icon â†’ **PdfIconFile**
10. **Ensure action is** `Run JavaScript`  
11. Click **+ Add library**  â†’ Search for *Coho* â†’ Select **CohoWinerySidePane** â†’ **Add**

![Add a library](image-50.png)

12. **Set the function name** to `openPOViewer`  

> [TIP] You find the function name in the JavaScript File

13. **Verify the command bar settings** â†’ you should see the following so far:

    | Property | Formula |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Label** | `Purchase Order Info` |
    | **Icon** | `Use Icon` â†’ `PdfIconFile` |
    | **Action** | `Run JavaScript` |
    | **Library** | `coh_CohoWinerySidePane` |
    | **Function** | `openPOViewer` |

### Should resemble the below settings

 ![Settings for command bar](image-25.png)

14. **Save and publish** - Play your app to verify that the button is visible on the Purchase Order form
15. In the model-driven app, select the **Purchase Order** table from the navigation
16. Click `+ New` to open a Form and locate the `Purchase Order Info` command bar button on the ribbon.
17. Verify that the button is visible and clickable â†’ The side pane should open on the right hand side with the message **Page not found**

![Test the button](image-14.png)

> ### Working with commands
> Sometimes the command bar ribbon misbehaves and the button might *disappear* from the Form. In that case, you should navigate to the editor of the commands and select the button, in our case the **Purchase Order Info** button and click on **Open formula bar** under **visability**. Set the formula to *true* - **Save and Publish**

![issues](image-55.png)

18. Close the browser window and get back to the configuration page for the command bar on the Purchase Order Form.


### Set parameters for passing information to the custom page
We are now setting the parameters for input to the JavaScript which will be passed on to the custom page

19. In the command bar editor, make sure that the `Purchase Order Info` command bar button is select in the ribbon.
20. Click on `+ Add parameter` â†’ You should be able to see **Parameter 1** with a dropdown field showing **String** as the default value

![Command bar button config](image-24.png)

21. **Edit Parameter 1 value:** â†’ Schema name of the page - should be this format **coh_purchaseordersidepane_c898a**

### ðŸ’¡ Find the page name 
> Navigate to your solution for **Coho Winery** and locate the **Purchase Order Side Pane** page. The **page name** will be visible in under the column **Name** and have the format **coh_purchaseordersidepane_c898a**
> 

22. Click **+ Add parameter**  â†’  Should be of type `string`
23. Set value of **Parameter 2** to the table column schema name for the **Purchase Order Number** in the **Purchase Order** table. Should be this format **coh_purchaseordernumber**. 

![Command bar Parameters](image-56.png)

> ### Working with parameters 
> **Parameter 1** is the reference to the side pane custom page and **Parameter 2** fetches the **purchase order number** for the current record and shows it in the **Title**
>
> When creating and updating parameter values for commands, the order of the parameters matter. The order is decided by the order of input parameters in the JavaScript function
> 
> In our case, the JavaScript expect pageName (the schema name of the page) first, then the fieldName (Purchase Order Number table column) for the function **openPOViewer(pageName, fieldName)** to work 
>

### Test the command for side pane on the Form of a **Purchase order**
24. **Save and publish** - Play your app to verify that the button is visible on the Purchase Order Form
25. In the model-driven app, select the **Purchase Order** table from the navigation
26. Click `+ New` to open a new Form or select an existing record. 
27. Locate the `Purchase Order Info` command bar button on the ribbon and verify that the side pane opens

![open side pane](image-57.png)


## ðŸ’¡ Fetch Record Details in the Custom Page

We now want to get the current record details from the open and selected item in the Model-Driven app, and display related information in the Custom Page 

1. **Open Custom Page** and select the .app properties - OnStart
   Configure the syntax to get the GUID of the current record from the JavaScript:

   <pre> Power fx
   Set(
    RecordItem,
    If(
        IsBlank(Param("recordId")),
        First(Sessions),
        "," in Text(Param("recordId")),
        LookUp(
            Sessions,
            Sessions= GUID(
                Last(
                    Split(
                        Param("recordId"),
                        ","
                    )
                ).Value
            )
        ),
        LookUp(
            Sessions,
            Sessions = GUID(Param("recordId"))
        )
    )
);
</pre>
