## Introduction 
In this lab you're going to learn how to configure the command bar to trigger the Custom Page in the Model-Driven app and how to use the record information in the Custom Page. 


## âœ¨ Getting Started with Command Bar Configuration for a form

To trigger the pop up dialog or side pane with the custom page, you will have to configure a command bar button to execute the JavaScript with the custom page reference

1. **Open your project solution** and locate the model-driven app which you will need to edit

9. **Provide a name** for the button on the right side  
10. **Select** `Run JavaScript`  
11. **Select or search** for the web resource as the library  
12. **Set the function name** to `JavaScriptFunction`  
13. **Set parameters**  
14. **Save and publish** â€“ then **Play** the app to test

## ðŸ’¡ Fetch Record Details in the Custom Page

We now want to get the current record details from the open and selected item in the Model-Driven app, and display related information in the Custom Page 

1. **Open Custom Page** and select the .app properties - OnStart
   Configure the syntax to get the GUID of the current record from the JavaScript:

   <pre> Power fx
   Set(
    RecordItem,
    If(
        IsBlank(Param("recordId")),
        First(Sessions),
        "," in Text(Param("recordId")),
        LookUp(
            Sessions,
            Sessions= GUID(
                Last(
                    Split(
                        Param("recordId"),
                        ","
                    )
                ).Value
            )
        ),
        LookUp(
            Sessions,
            Sessions = GUID(Param("recordId"))
        )
    )
);
</pre>
