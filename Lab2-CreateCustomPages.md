# Lab 2 - Create Beautiful Custom Pages

In this lab, you will learn how to **build Custom Pages** with a focus on **responsive design**, **Styling** and accessing **Model-Driven App record details**

## Lab Overview 

### 🎯 Goal

- Build a Custom Page to use as a full page, side pane, and dialog inside a Model-Driven App.
- Connect to your data sources and fetch record details with the Param() function in the Custom Page.
- Master responsive layouts so your page looks good everywhere.
- Add modern styling elements like shadows, rounded corners, blur effects, and SVGs to make apps pop
- Optimised Power Fx syntax for reusability, performance and maintainable applications

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Completion of [Lab 1 - Create a Model-Driven Power App](Lab1-CreateModelDrivenPowerApp.md)

### Scenario

Coho Winery are rolling out a new Purchase Order app to replace their manual Word-and-screenshot process. To improve the user experience, you have been asked to design two key pages: 

- **Landing Page** – a modern entry point where users can quickly navigate to key links, view PO data from the ERP system, and access important actions.
- **PO Document Side Pane** – a page that displays stored PDF versions of PO requests, giving finance and auditors instant access without leaving the app.

Together, these pages will provide both an attractive front door to the application and a practical way to view and manage PO request documents. 

### ⌛ Length

This lab will take approximately 60–75 minutes to complete. 

## ✍️ Exercise 1: Create a Landing Page and Configure Settings

We will begin by creating the first custom **Landing Page** that will be presented to the users. This page will set the tone for the app and gives users a clear "home base" to work from as the first thing they will see when opening the **Coho Winery Purchase Order** app.

1. Navigate to the [Power Apps Maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and ensure you are in the **Developer** environment you created in Lab 0.
2. Select **Solutions** from the left navigation pane.

3. Select the **Coho Winery** solution you created in Lab 0.

4. In the solution, select **New** -> **App** -> **Page** from the command bar.

5. The canvas designer page will load. Click on **Settings** in the ribbon.

6. On the **General** tab, verify that the **Auto save** option is set to **On**.

7. Click on the **Display** tab and verify that the **Scale to fit** option is set to **Off**. Click on **Close** when you are finished.

8. On the canvas designer, click the **Save** icon in the upper right corner. In the **Save as** dialog, enter **Coho Winery Landing Page** as the name and click on **Save**.

![Images/Lab2-CreateCustomPages/E1_7.png](Images/Lab2-CreateCustomPages/E1_7.png)

9. Once the page has saved, click on **Back** and then **Leave** to return to the solution.

10. Verify that the **Coho Winery Landing Page** is listed in the solution. The new component should be of type **Page**.

11. Keep the **Coho Winery PP Solution** solution open, as we will continue to work on it in the next exercise.

## ✍️ Exercise 2: Build a Responsive Layout

**The goal**: Ensure that the page works and the content looks great on all screens by understanding containers.

1. Insert a vertical container as the main foundation for the layout
2. Name it cntMainVertical
3. Center it on the screen by setting the X & Y formulas on the container

<pre> Power Fx 
X: (Parent.Width - Self.Width) / 2
Y: (Parent.Height - Self.Height) / 2
</pre>

*💡 This will center and align the main container whenever the screen size is adjusted*


**Build the navigation bar**
4. Inside cntMainVertical - insert a horizontal container
5. Name it cntHeaderHorizontal and adjust the Width to:

<pre> Power Fx 
Width: Parent.Width
</pre>

*💡 This ensures the width of the second container to always reflect the size of the Parent cntMainVerticals width*

6. In the cntHeaderHorizontal container, insert another
4. Nest horizontal containers within the main container
5. Create the navigation bar



## ✍️ Exercise 3: Fetch Record Information
1. Add datasource (Dataverse, SharePoint etc.)
2. Select **App** in the left corner and click **Formulas**
3. Create a formula for referencing the record GUID and use the function GUID() to ensure correct type

<pre> Power Fx 
nfRecordItem =
    If(
        "," in Text(Param("recordId")),
        LookUp(Table, 'Unique GUID field' = GUID(Last(Split(Param("recordId"), ",")).Value)),
        LookUp(Table, 'Unique GUID field'  = GUID(Param("recordId")))
    ); </pre>

The record can also be wrapped in {} so that needs to be removed in some cases:

<pre> Power Fx 
GUID(Substitute(Substitute(Param("recordId"), "{", ""), "}", ""))</pre>

> **Note:** 
*Named Formulas needs to be closed using ;*

*Param() function gets the record GUID parsed from the JavaScript, and GUID() formats the output as GUID, not a string. We are also checking if there are several records selected by splitting the string after ","*

## ✍️ Exercise 4: Styling 
**Ideas:** 
- Add rounded corners for modern look (between 5-10 border radius)
- Set a slight box shadow 
- Add effects that provides depth and  to your apps

**4b: Add HTML blur to your page - Glass Morphism effect:**
1. Insert HTMLtext control
2. Edit text value to be:

<pre> HTML
$" <div style='
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2); /* Solid background */
border-radius: 16px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
width: {Self.Width-2}px;
height: {Self.Height-2}px;
padding: 10px; /* Adds space inside the box */
overflow: hidden; /* Prevents scrollbars */
box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensures padding is included in width/height */
position: absolute; /* Allows absolute positioning */
top: 0; /* Aligns to the top */
left: 0; /* Aligns to the left */
color: white; /* Default text color for fallback */
font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; /* Sets the font to Poppins */
'>
</pre>

3. Add Horizontal or vertical containers above the HTML TEXT control if you want it to be the background

*💡 Change the effect and looks of the blur on https://css.glass/*


## Exercise 5: Working with YAML
1. Copy the container you have built
2. Add it to another screen


## Exercise 6: Wokring with SVGs
1. Add an image control 
2. Build the SVG code (for icons Bootstrap is a great source for generating SVG code)
3. Alter the code to your needs with dynamic values using set variables

<pre> SVG code
"data:image/svg+xml," & EncodeUrl("<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='16' height='16' fill='" & varHexValue & "' class='bi bi-plus-lg' viewBox='0 0 16 16'>
  <path fill-rule='evenodd' d='M8 2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v5h5a.5.5 0 0 1 0 1h-5v5a.5.5 0 0 1-1 0v-5h-5a.5.5 0 0 1 0-1h5v-5A.5.5 0 0 1 8 2'/>
</svg>")

</pre>

## 🌟 Extra Challenges

- Add dark mode 
- Add CSS styling 
- Add SVGs for design 
- Adjust styling of the container and alignment of items
