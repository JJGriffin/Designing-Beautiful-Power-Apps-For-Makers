# Designing Beautiful Apps for Functional Makers: A Masterclass in Fusing Power Apps Capabilities

Repository to store all assets for the **Designing Beautiful Apps for Functional Makers: A Masterclass in Fusing Power Apps Capabilities** workshop, first delivered as part of [Nordic Summit](https://nordicsummit.info/) 2025.


## Abstract

In the beginning, there were two Power App types â€“ canvas and model-driven. And everything was goodâ€¦well, kind of. Creating visually compelling apps was still incredibly challenging, often requiring the skills of a front-end developer and a whole bunch of HTML / CSS to make things look pretty. Today, we are a lot more fortunate. With extraordinary capabilities such as custom pages, the division between apps is slowly disappearing. But, the challenge of easily embedding canvas apps into model-driven apps still exists. So how can we, as makers, go from building typically functional solutions to something that can impress our colleagues, users and clients? And can this all be done in a nice, efficient, low-code way?

Join us for this all-day workshop as our technical and design experts show you the art of the possible and why bringing canvas and model-driven together is so effective. Youâ€™ll discover some of the latest innovations available in the platform, see how easy it is to work with them and also work through a series of lab exercises where you can put what you learnt to practice and walk away with your very own functional and feature-rich application, that blends all of the platform capabilities in an interesting way. With reference to actual real-world usage cases, this workshop will help take your proficient app building skills to the next level!

### Key Takeaways

- Learn how to build responsive and functional applications
- Learn how to integrate and embed Power Apps custom pages in model-driven apps
- Learn how to extend functionality in model-driven apps by utilizing custom pages
- Learn more about how to utilize HTML
- Demonstrate how containers can rock your world ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜ We will show practical examples of how these can be used to build a responsive app design and modernise the appearance of traditional, legacy applications.
